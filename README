DESCRIPTION:
A tool to animate a simple network buffer + wire.

It was written in order to demonstrate network issues such as "bufferbloat".

Sample video:
http://kieranclancy.com/bufferbloat/sample.avi
[ sequence used: g=1:4:17 g=19:2:47 g=48:1:54 b=55 g=64:12 ]

REQUIREMENTS:
Requires inkscape and mencoder to run
Will use "Blue Highway Condensed" from the Larabie fonts package if available

USAGE:
1) Set the variables at the top section of the 'animate' script appropriately.
   The current values are sensible defaults. The most significant variable is
   the 'sequence' variable, which is documented a little further down in the
   script. The 'sequence' tool is also useful for testing packet sequences
   manually.
2) Run the 'animate' script from the base directory.
   $ ./animate
3) Afterwards, the video should be available in 'buffer.avi'
